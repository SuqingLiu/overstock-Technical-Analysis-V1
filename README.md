I lean toward fundamental analysis over technical analysis when purchasing stocks.

Since technical analysis can be performed more automatically than fundamental analysis, I created this tool to help me conduct quick technical assessments.

The current version focuses on testing a few technical parameters, including moving averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and Fibonacci levels.

Please note that the website currently lacks security measures—I’m exposing the port directly and do not have HTTPS because I don’t own a domain yet. Therefore, I kindly ask that you do not overload the server while testing its features.

I plan to add a domain and enhance security later if I find this tool to be truly useful. However, based on the recent significant fluctuations in the stock market, the current version hasn’t proven to be very effective.

New features will be added soon. Please feel free to suggest any new features. I’m currently considering either adopting an agentic workflow where different trading agents analyze the data and provide recommendations, or offering users the most up-to-date news directly.
